1. We don't need to install EnKF (we may get errors when install cloud analysis with EnKF):
=> src/makefile_DTC => remove the line "( cd main/enkf; ls; echo "Making $@ in `pwd`" ; make -f Makefile );"

2. There is a bug when run GSD cloud analysis without surface data:
In src/main/gsdcloudanalysis.F90, the memory of wimaxstation is only assigned if there's "mta_cld" data (allocate(wimaxstation(numsao))),
however, the original code assign value to wimaxstation even it's memory is not assigned (e.g., only radar is analyzed). The solution is:
Origin => "wimaxstation=0.0_r_single"
Modified => "!wimaxstation=0.0_r_single"
